About my Major
</h1>
<p style="color: green;">
Like I said in my first page, I'm a commercial aviation major. What that means is I'm studying to be a pilot for the airlines,
while also doing a mix of general classes, such as this one. I 've also included a picture below that was taken after my first flight at UND.
