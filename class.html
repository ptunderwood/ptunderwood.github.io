AVIT102
</h1>
<p>
One of my classes this semester is AVIT102: Introduction to Aviation. Essentially, this class is the first class in the Commercial Aviation
pathway that involves flying. The actual first class in the pathway is AVIT100, but there's no flying involved in that class, so
102 is really the start of the pathway to me. The class is taught by Professor Leslie Martin, and is made of two parts: The classroom portion, and the flight portion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The classroom portion of AVIT102 is pretty self explanatory, it covers all the knowledge based subjects we need for a private pilot's license.
It is broken down into 7 blocks, each focusing on a specific subject or two. For example, block two is Airworthiness (what makes an airplane legally able to fly).
</p>
<br>
<p>
The flight portion of AVIT102 is where the fun is. Each student is paired with a flight instructor, and you cover about 30 lessons over the semester.
Each lesson focuses on a specific area, for example lesson one is a breifing about UND policy, lesson two is an aerodynamics demonstration in a simulator, etc.
</p>
<br>
<p>
AVIT102 is a 5 credit class. The classroom portion of the class is 2 hours a day, 3 days a week, and the flying portion is 3 hours a day, 3 days a week.
