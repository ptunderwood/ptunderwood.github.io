My hobbies
</h1>
<h2>
Flight Simulator
</h2>
<p>
I only have a couple hobbies: Flight Simulator and Sim Racing. Flight simulator is pretty self explanatory, it was my only way 
to fly for many years.

<h2 style="color: green;">
Sim Racing
</h2>
<p>
Sim Racing is a little more complicated. I race on a platform called iRacing, where there's no AI, only real 
people racing each other. I've raced a variety of drivers ranging from an 80 year old man to a 7 year old, and total novices to world champions.
I've included a picture of my HyVee IndyCar that I race.
